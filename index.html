                <p>Hello! my name is Pernell! My favorite things to do are coding and making music. I first got into
                    as a middle schooler playing the trumpet and eventually it turned into a want to produce music.
                    I guess I suddenly just wanted to attempt putting things together and so far it has been a strong 7
                    (going on 8 years)!<br>

                    <p>My interest in coding came from the music which is why I mentioned it first. As I got more into
                        it, it required more and
                        and more power which forced me to learn about computers and little did I realize, it was very
                        interesting. What started off
                        as just normal hardware knowledge slowly developed into software and soon after, I began to
                        expand my knowledge on programs
                        and websites as well as how they were made and what tools are necessary to do so. I also
                        photoshop images on the side!</p>

                    <font size="1">This is my first group project. It was supposed to be a game that we were creating,
                        something along
                        the lines of a defense game like "Age of Heroes" (a mobile game). We were trying to use
                        different libraries as well
                        as firebase to achieve the ability to have multiple users interact as well as play on their
                        own. It is something we plan
                        on finishing as we move further in the future. The structure of the actual game relies on
                        babylon.js, possible by
                        our team member Patrick. Big thanks to Rob for being able to link all this together!

                            artist
                            you search, and create a button from it. After the button you generated is clicked, it
                            would show 10 gifs
                            related to the artist name you typed.

                            This project is a trivia game that gives you 100 seconds to answer 8 "fill in the blank"
                            quesitons (music quotes)
                            This was possible utilizing the setTimeout() and setInterval() functions.

                        <a>Another game project. This one presents you with 4 crystal with which you can click.
                            Everytime you
                            refresh the page or press the "reset" button, a randomly generated number will appear on
                            the screen. The goal is to
                            click the crystals until the amount is reached, though if you go passed that amount, you
                            lose. It's tough...
